LT3652 Charger - Tested OK

Specs:
	-8.4V float-voltage
	-2A charging current - make sure your battery can handle it!
	-No balancing, manual cell-voltage monitoring required.

Notes:
	-If a 12V regulator with sufficient current-handling capabilities can be found, use that instead of a 15V one.
	-Voltage regulator and LT3652 get HOT. Heatsinking is required, forced-air highly recommended.
	-NTC footprint does not need to be populated.
	-Charge LED will flicker if no battery is connected - this is supposed to happen.

Future:
	-uC control.
	-Balaning.
	-Better heatsinking.
